# Get Started with Open Source

Hacktoberfest is all about helping people who are new to open source get comfortable with the process. Here are some ways you can get involved.

#### Fix Typos in ReadMes

Destory all typos :)

#### Improve Outdated Documentation

Have you ever found documentation that is missing steps or that only worked in previous versions? Adding to documentation helps the developer and the community.

#### Search Issues with Labels

You can search open issues and narrow down the results by language and difficulty.
